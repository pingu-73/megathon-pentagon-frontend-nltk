# Purpose:
We built an app, that can be used for **personality based classification** and qualification criteria for job interviews. The final results are 
calculated in a model trained with ML.
This app has a basic **puzzle based test**, which is used for personality classification. The output of this test is sent to the database, where 
other phases of this **virtual interview**, based on **social media analysis** is calculated.

# Overview:
While building this app we've used **Android Studio** platform in **Kotlin** language. User data and Psyche Test Details are sent to **Firebase database** where the user socil-media links are scraped and as per social-media scores and psychetest scores the role for the individual is selected for **suitable roles**. And the **result is than e-mailed** regarding further interview rounds.
